# Nexium_Hashir_Task1

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## ðŸ“… Daily Log

**Day 1:** Set up the basic Next.js app with all package files, created a homepage for the quote generator, and explored routing.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
