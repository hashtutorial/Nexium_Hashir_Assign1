# Nexium_Hashir_Task1

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## ðŸ“… Daily Log

**Day 1:** Set up the basic Next.js app with all package files, created a homepage for the quote generator, and explored routing.

**Day 2:** Understood React server and client components (advantages, disadvantages, use cases) and built the `/quotes` page using both types.

### Day 3: UI Library Integration with ShadCN

- Integrated **ShadCN UI** into the Next.js project successfully.
- Customized and themed components using Tailwind utilities.
- Replaced the original homepage with a clean, modern layout using:
  - `<Card>` and `<Button>` from ShadCN
  - Responsive, minimal styling with Tailwind
- Added **Framer Motion** to animate quote transitions smoothly.
- The UI is now cleaner, more modular, and production-ready.

---

### Day 4: Enhancing UI with DaisyUI and Tailwind

- Installed and configured **DaisyUI** with Tailwind CSS.
- Combined **ShadCN + DaisyUI** to enhance visuals without conflict.
- Added new features:
  - DaisyUI `alert` component for quote feedback
  - Author `badge` based on name length
  - Randomized font color on each quote generation
- Ensured all components are accessible and mobile responsive.
- Refactored alert styling to remove icons and improve visibility.
- Project now looks **polished, modern, and dynamic**.
