all pages made are server components by default no need for "use server" directive
server side functions/actions e.g preprocessing user input after form

cant interact with browser apis or handle user interations

any component which has any event e.g form
react hooks like useState, useEffect can only be used in client components
rendered once on server side and then on the client side
